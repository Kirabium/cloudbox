# CloudBox Development Journal

## Project Overview
CloudBox is a serverless file storage API built on AWS infrastructure. This journal documents the development process, challenges, and decisions made during the implementation.

## Architecture Decisions

### Serverless Approach
We chose a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB to create a scalable, cost-effective solution with minimal maintenance overhead.

### Authentication Strategy
The API supports two authentication methods:
- API Key-based authentication for simplicity
- JWT-based authentication for more advanced use cases

Both methods store their secrets in AWS Secrets Manager for secure management.

### File Storage Design
Files are stored in S3 with a user-specific prefix in the key to maintain isolation. We use presigned URLs for secure access to files without exposing them publicly.

### Metadata Storage
File metadata is stored in DynamoDB with a composite primary key (userId + fileId) for efficient retrieval and a GSI on createdAt for time-based queries.

## Development Timeline

### Week 1: Infrastructure Design
- Created initial Terraform configuration
- Set up S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, and IAM roles
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Week 2: API Implementation
- Developed Lambda functions for file operations
- Implemented authentication middleware
- Added CORS support and error handling

### Week 3: Testing and Monitoring
- Added CloudWatch alarms and dashboards
- Set up Datadog integration
- Comprehensive testing of the API

## Challenges Faced

### Multipart Form Parsing
Lambda doesn't have built-in multipart form parsing. We implemented a custom parser to handle file uploads.

### State Management in Terraform
Managing multiple environments (dev/prod) required careful use of Terraform workspaces and remote state management.

### Security Considerations
Implementing least privilege IAM policies and ensuring secure access to files required careful planning of the security model.

## Future Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for frequently accessed files
- Optimize Lambda cold start times

### Feature Enhancements
- Add support for file versioning
- Implement file sharing between users
- Add search capabilities for file metadata

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Multi-region deployment for improved resilience
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates advanced cloud architecture design and DevOps practices. The serverless approach provides excellent scalability and cost-efficiency while maintaining robust security and performance.
